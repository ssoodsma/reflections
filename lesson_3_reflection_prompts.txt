When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To be able to share changes to the repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So code doesn't change unexpectedly while I'm working on it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork allows you to copy a repo on GitHub into your own account on GitHub.
		Cloning copies a repo either from GitHub to your computer, or clone a repo to another repo on the same computer.
		Branching allows you to change code like adding a new feature but not affecting the master branch until its complete.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you are going to be offline, it provides a local copy of the remote branch to view.
		It allows conflicts to be resolved using git log and git diff.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
