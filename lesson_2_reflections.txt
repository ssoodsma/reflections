What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The git metadata and file structure are created. This is required to manage a file repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a logical storage place that remembers all of the files that have been added prior to a commit.
It allows multiple changes to be group together in the staging area making one logical commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Only add changed files that are relevant to the logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I want to try out a new feature, but not change the main code.  Branches maintain multiple copies of the source 
so that multiple versions can exist simultaneously.
